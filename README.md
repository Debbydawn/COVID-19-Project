## Abstract

## Introduction
The world suddenly experienced a perilous reality on the 11th of March, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel corona-virus (COVID-19) a pandemic originating from Wuhan, China. Cases rapidly spread to other countries such as Japan, South Korea, Europe, the United States, and later the entire world. The negative effects have ranged from a severe contraction of GDP in many countries to multi-dimensional environmental and social issues across the strata of society

## Project Aim
The aim of this study is to identify the effects that COVID-19 has on the environment (Carbon Emission) and the global economy (GDP per capita). However, 237 countries are utilized in the study that involves Covid-19 data between Jan 2020 and September 2022. Economic factor (Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita) from the year 2018 to the year 2021 for 266 countries will be utilized and 210 countries in the analysis that involves the CO2 emissions for the same period. The Datasets on COVID-19, Carbon Emission (CO2), and GDP per capita were collected from WHO, European Union, and World Development Indicator respectively

## Methodology
The analysis aspect of this study is going to be conducted with the use of  Python for data cleaning, data normalization, data analysis, Tableau for data visualization, and PowerPoint/Jupyter for the presentation of results. Also, we would be utilizing a Linear Regression to predict the effect of  COVID-19 on Carbon emission and on the GDP per capita of various countries of the world.
